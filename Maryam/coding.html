        <h1>Coding Learning Journey</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my coding learning journey! This page documents my experiences, challenges, and successes as I embark on the exciting adventure of learning how to code from scratch.
        </p>

        <h2>Part 1: Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            In the initial phase, I focused on understanding the basics of programming languages and familiarizing myself with key concepts. I explored resources like Codecademy and freeCodeCamp to build a solid foundation.
        </p>

        <h2>Part 2: Choosing a Language</h2>
        <p>
            After gaining some familiarity, I delved into choosing a programming language based on my goals and interests. I explored languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Java, evaluating their applications and community support.
        </p>

        <h2>Part 3: Hands-On Projects</h2>
        <p>
            To reinforce my learning, I started working on small coding projects. These projects helped me apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and build a portfolio showcasing my skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Part 4: Online Courses and Tutorials</h2>
        <p>
            I enrolled in online courses from platforms like Coursera and Udacity, gaining in-depth knowledge and practical insights from industry experts. The structured courses provided a systematic approach to learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Part 5: Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            Learning to code comes with its challenges. I encountered difficulties, such as debugging complex code and grasping advanced concepts. However, through perseverance and seeking help from online communities like Stack Overflow, I overcame these challenges.
        </p>

        <h2>Part 6: Building a Network</h2>
        <p>
            Networking is crucial in the tech industry. I attended coding meetups, joined online forums, and connected with fellow learners and professionals. Building a network provided me with valuable insights, mentorship, and collaborative opportunities.
